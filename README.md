# Allstate Claim Costs
My first project using Tensorflow (or any deep learning techniques, for that matter). The data files are from the
[Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data). The code was written in Python 3
and the required modules are Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, sci-kit learn, and dependencies.
